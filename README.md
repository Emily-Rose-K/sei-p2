# Concept
A project tracker app built for teams to keep track of goals and celebrate accomplishments! The app will integrate with Slack’s Web-API by sending messages when goals are reached or milestones are past due. You’ve got this in the BHAG.

# Current functionality:
- a user can create a team, or join an existing team
- once a user belongs to a team, they can log in to view their team page
- on the team page, a user will see all goals, projects, and milestones that the team has created
- milestones can be completed and will get crossed off

# Functionality coming soon, when I figure out how to make slack bots:
- slack bot will announce when a goal has been reached or a project has been completed


# Closing Thoughts:
- I wish I had vetted my idea and my models with a TA or instructor sooner, and more thoroughly
- I wish I had spent less time documenting/planning and more time getting my hands dirty
- I wihs I had started playing with more of the slack web-api functionality sooner
  - I was able to run a simple script in the week prior to project week and thought creating the bot would be easier than it was
